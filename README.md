I set up a new folder on my computer via the command line using
mkdir the_odin_project

I then cd into the folder
I create a repo on github and used the SSH key to git clone the repository into the folder on my computer.
I then cd into the name of the repository 
when in the repository i used touch README.md to create this file
I then opened this file and wrote this brief intro into what i did to get here

I need to now add and commit my files to my repo in github

git add README.md
git commit -m README.md
git push origin master

README.md file had now been pushed to my githb repo
